# W.O.P.R. Display

W.O.P.R Display is a modern take on the W.O.P.R. missile launch sequence from the 1983 movie War Games.

I love the movie War Games - It was one of my first glimpses into computers and how they could be connected, and I thought that the W.O.P.R. computer in the movie was amazing, with all of it's flashing LEDs and computer noises.

But most of all, I loved the intense missile unlock sequence in the movie. W.O.P.R. guessing the unlock code, while Matthew Broderick tries to teach it that no one ever wins. It was exciting and I always wanted to make a "replica" of that unlock sequence... and I finally did!

# Arduino code

This repository has the final code for your W.O.P.R. kit. It's written specifically for an ESP32, though not specifically for the TinyPICO, but the kit is designed to have a TinyPICO and Audio Shield plug directly into it.  

To flash the code onto your board, you'll need to have the  Arduino IDE installed and the ESP32 board files installed from the Arduino Board Manager.


# Where can I get one?
